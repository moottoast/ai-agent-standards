# Testing Standards (RSpec + FactoryBot, Test-First)

## Context

- When creating or modifying specs.
- Defer to AGENTS.md for the non-negotiables (tests first, RSpec only, FactoryBot only, no fixtures).
- When fixing failing specs, confirm expected behavior against application docs and/or product requirements before changing code.

## Requirements

- Write/adjust the spec first (Red), then implement (Green), then refactor (Refactor).
- For failing-test fixes, first decide whether the current spec matches documented product intent:
  - If no, refactor the spec to align with docs/requirements.
  - If yes, fix the implementation (or minimal test setup issue) to satisfy the spec.
- Use FactoryBot factories and traits; avoid fixtures entirely.
- Prefer behavior-focused specs; avoid testing Rails internals.
- Keep setup readable; use `let`/`before` sparingly and intentionally.
- Mock/stub at boundaries only (external services, time, randomness).
- For Turbo confirmation flows or PATCH/DELETE links, use system specs with `:js` and the repo’s existing Turbo confirm helpers.
- For failing-test fix requests, verify with file-scoped runs only (for example `bundle exec rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb`); do not run the full suite.
- Include a verification section in responses: file-scoped `bundle exec rspec path/to/spec_file.rb`, and when relevant, `bundle exec bundler-audit check --update` + `bundle exec brakeman`.

## Examples

<example>
```ruby
require "rails_helper"

RSpec.describe InvoiceTotalCalculator, type: :service do
  it "returns the summed total in cents" do
    invoice_record = create(:invoice, :with_line_items, line_item_count: 2, line_item_amount_cents: 1500)

    expect(described_class.new(invoice_record: invoice_record).call).to eq(3000)
  end
end
```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
```ruby
require "rails_helper"

RSpec.describe User do
  let(:user) { users(:one) } # fixtures are not allowed

  it "works" do
    expect(user).to be_present
  end
end
```
</example>

## Anti-Patterns

- Introducing or expanding Minitest usage for new tests.
- Using fixtures or referencing `users(:one)` / YAML fixture data.
- Large, brittle specs that over-mock internal behavior.
- Jumping straight to implementation fixes for failing specs without checking docs/requirements first.
- Running the full suite when the task is specifically fixing known failing specs.
