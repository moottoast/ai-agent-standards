description: Apply service object conventions for app/services
globs: ["app/services/**/*.rb"]

# Service Object Standards (Scoped)

## Context

- When creating or modifying service objects in `app/services`.

## Requirements

- Follow the repo’s naming convention for services (typically VerbNounService).
- Keep services single-responsibility with explicit inputs/outputs.
- Prefer an instance `#call`/`#run` method as established in this repo.
- Handle errors explicitly (exceptions or a result object) consistent with existing services.
- Avoid hidden side effects; write services that are straightforward to test.
- Add tests first (per AGENTS.md): service specs should cover happy path + edge cases.
