# Rails Views + Tailwind Standards (Scoped)

## Context

- When editing ERB templates in this repo.

## Requirements

- Use Tailwind utility classes per existing view/component conventions.
- Ensure responsive layouts and dark mode support where the design system already uses it.
- Use `content_for :title` for page titles if that is the established convention.
- Prefer partials for repeated UI patterns; follow existing component/partial naming.
- Use Turbo Streams and `dom_id` as appropriate, matching existing patterns.
- Maintain accessibility: labels, aria attributes, focus states.
- Add tests first when behavior changes: use system/request specs as appropriate (per AGENTS.md).
