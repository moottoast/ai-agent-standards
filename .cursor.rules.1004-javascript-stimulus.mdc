description: Apply Stimulus controller conventions for app/javascript
globs: ["app/javascript/**/*.js"]

# JavaScript + Stimulus Standards (Scoped)

## Context

- When creating or modifying Stimulus controllers or JS in `app/javascript`.

## Requirements

- Use modern ES modules and Stimulus conventions (controllers, targets, values).
- Keep actions single-responsibility and avoid unnecessary DOM surgery; prefer class toggles.
- Document controller purpose and example markup at the top of the file.
- Clean up resources in `disconnect()`.
- If the repo uses tailwindcss-stimulus-components, prefer those components over custom implementations.
- Add tests first where feasible; for JS-heavy flows, prefer system specs with `:js` (per AGENTS.md).
