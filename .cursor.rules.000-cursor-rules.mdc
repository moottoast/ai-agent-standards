description: Maintain Cursor rules: keep them scoped, minimal, and aligned with AGENTS.md

# Cursor Rule Maintenance (Meta)

## Context

- Applies only when creating or updating Cursor rule files in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`.
- AGENTS.md is the canonical, cross-agent source of truth for behavior and global standards.

## Requirements

- Do not duplicate global guidance from AGENTS.md in every rule file; keep `.mdc` rules scoped to the file globs.
- Prefer short, machine-actionable bullets over long prose.
- Frontmatter must only include `description` and `globs`.
- When a rule needs an example, include the smallest possible good and invalid example.
- If a rule conflicts with AGENTS.md, update the rule to defer to AGENTS.md unless Cursor-specific behavior requires otherwise.

## Examples

<example>
```md

description: Apply controller-specific conventions for RESTful Rails controllers
globs: ["app/controllers/**/*.rb"]

# Rails Controller Standards

## Context

## Requirements
